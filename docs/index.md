## Animation of the Evolution

The histogram of population in BC space during a typical run is shown below. Bins with lighter color has the most individuals. The x axis is the spectral flatness (dB) and the y axis is spectral centroid (Hz). As can be seen from the animation, methods with novelty objective (NSGC, NSLC) explores a wider region, leading to the discovery of diverse solutions.
